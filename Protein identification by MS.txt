Protein identification by MS
To identify and quantify changes in the protein expression due to the Maf1 overexpression, 100 µg of total protein extracts obtained from L. major pLMRIB-Maf1 and WT cells were stacked and excised from Gel Code Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB)-stained gels. The samples were analyzed at the Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Core Facility at State University of New York Upstate Medical University using a NanoAcquity nano-flow liquid chromatography (LC) system (Waters), coupled to a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Proteins were identified from the tandem MS data using SEQUEST software with searches in the TryTrypDB and UniProt Databases and protein quantification was performed using the Label-Free Quantification (LFQ) method. Protein hits with FDR ≤0.05, p-value ≤0.05 and differences in protein expression between Maf1 overexpression and the WT were ≥1.2-fold change was considered as DEPs. GO enrichment analysis was used to classify the identified DEPs. KEGG pathway analysis was used to analyze the biological functions of DEPs.
